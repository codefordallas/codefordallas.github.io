# Things To Remember About Nav Section

## Adding New (or Removing) Headers

When adding or removing a header nav menu item, you need to:

1. update [clearNavFunc.js]("./clearNavFunc.js") - as of May 2023, we do not have a template set up so it is hard coded.

2. Update WayPoints (add or remove as needed) from [App.js]("../../App.js")
